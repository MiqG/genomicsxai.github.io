## Introduction (or other name for your first section)

Your content here. Use standard Markdown. For images in the post folder:

## Section two

...
```

Maintainers can also populate DOI metadata automatically at deploy time via `data/zenodo.json` when `ZENODO_API_TOKEN` is configured in GitHub Actions.

See [BLOG_SPEC.md](./BLOG_SPEC.md) for full frontmatter and tag options.

## References

End every post with a numbered References section citing the primary literature
it builds on, giving each entry a DOI or publisher link where one exists:

```markdown
## References

1. Avsec, Ž. et al. Advancing regulatory variant effect prediction with AlphaGenome. *Nature*, 649, 1206–1218 (2026). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-10014-0
2. Linder, J. et al. Predicting RNA-seq coverage from DNA sequence as a unifying model of gene regulation. *Nature Genetics*, 57, 949–961 (2025). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-024-02053-6
```

Write the numbers as `1.`, `2.` — **not** `1\.`, `2\.`. The escaped form looks
fine in the source but renders as plain paragraphs instead of a numbered list,
which is what a parser looks for. Check the built preview shows a real list.

This is not required for acceptance, but it appears to matter for whether the
post shows up in Google Scholar. Scholar only indexes documents it classifies
as scholarly articles, and a bibliography seems to be one of the signals it
uses. We can't see Google's classifier, so treat this as an observation rather
than a rule — but across our own posts, every indexed one ends with a rendered
numbered list of five or more references, and the ones still missing had four or
fewer (or a bibliography that wasn't rendering as a list), independent of
length, date, or authorship. The DOIs themselves don't appear to be the deciding
factor: our earliest indexed post has none. See the
[submission
guidelines](https://genomicsxai.github.io/submission-guidelines/#why-references-matter-for-google-scholar).
