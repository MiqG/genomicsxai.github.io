{{< summary >}}
**ENCODE GRAMMAR** (Genomic Regulatory Atlas of sequence Models, Motifs, Annotations and Rules) is a collection of 3,865 experiment-specific deep learning model sets and derived sequence annotations that connect the ENCODE project's human gene regulation maps from extensive biochemical profiling experiments to the underlying DNA sequence features that drive regulatory activity. 

This five-minute **quickstart guide** shows how to find an ENCODE GRAMMAR model-set and its associated annotation and load its most commonly used outputs into an interactive genome browser. By following the steps below, you will create a browser session displaying an experimentally observed regulatory profile, the corresponding model-predicted profile, and a base-resolution sequence-contribution map.

## Quick-start guide (5 min)
ENCODE GRAMMAR transforms individual ENCODE experiments into experiment-specific BPNet-family model sets together with predicted regulatory profiles, sequence-contribution maps, predictive motifs, motif instances, and variant-effect predictions. Readers who are new to the resource may wish to begin with the [**ENCODE GRAMMAR overview**](https://genomicsxai.github.io/blogs/2026-012/), which explains the biological motivation, model families, interpretation workflow, and complete collection of released products.

Below, we explain how to navigate an ENCODE GRAMMAR model-set annotation page and load several commonly used model outputs into the WashU Epigenome Browser. Visualizing these tracks is a useful first step before designing larger-scale quantitative analyses.

We use the example of a **ChromBPNet model set generated from an ATAC-seq experiment in K562 cells (ENCSR893SUD)**.

### Step 1: Find the model-set annotation page

Open the ChromBPNet model-set annotation for K562 ATAC-seq: [https://www.encodeproject.org/annotations/ENCSR893SUD/](https://www.encodeproject.org/annotations/ENCSR893SUD/).

Model-set annotations associated with an experiment can also be found from the corresponding experiment summary page.

![Figure 1](Fig1.png "ENCODE Portal annotation page for the K562 ATAC-seq ChromBPNet model set ENCSR893SUD.")

A searchable list of all ENCODE annotations is available at [https://www.encodeproject.org/annotations/](https://www.encodeproject.org/annotations/).

### Step 2: Find the files of interest

Scroll to the middle of the annotation page and select the **File details** tab to browse the available files.

For an initial exploration of a ChromBPNet model set, we recommend viewing three complementary tracks:

1. the **normalized observed signal profile**, representing the experimentally measured chromatin-accessibility profile;
2. the **normalized predicted signal profile**, representing the regulatory profile predicted by ChromBPNet from DNA sequence; and
3. the **counts sequence-contribution scores**, estimating how much each DNA base contributes to the model's prediction of total accessibility.

![Figure 2](Fig2-3.png "File details tab for the K562 ATAC-seq ChromBPNet model set ENCSR893SUD.")

The following steps require the URLs of these bigWig files. Right-click the **download icon** beside a file and select **Copy link address**. The links for this example are provided here:

- **Normalized observed signal profile**: [https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF880ZUI/@@download/ENCFF880ZUI.bigWig](https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF880ZUI/@@download/ENCFF880ZUI.bigWig)
- **Normalized predicted signal profile**: [https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF296ICJ/@@download/ENCFF296ICJ.bigWig](https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF296ICJ/@@download/ENCFF296ICJ.bigWig)
- **Counts sequence contribution scores**: [https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF407GCO/@@download/ENCFF407GCO.bigWig](https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF407GCO/@@download/ENCFF407GCO.bigWig)

This quickstart focuses on these three tracks. Additional ENCODE GRAMMAR products, including predictive motif-instance annotations, can be accessed through the ENCODE Portal and the UCSC Track Hub linked below.

For descriptions of the complete collection of files and model-derived products, see the [**ENCODE GRAMMAR overview**](https://genomicsxai.github.io/blogs/2026-012/) and the [**ENCODE 4 preprint**](https://doi.org/10.64898/2026.07.06.731365).

### Step 3: Load the bigwigs into the WashU genome browser

Navigate to the [WashU Epigenome Browser](https://epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/browser2022/). On the home page, find the **Human** section and select **hg38** to open a new browser session.

![Figure 3](Fig3.png "WashU Epigenome Browser home page with the human hg38 genome assembly selected.")

In the new browser session, select the **Tracks** icon at the top of the page and then choose **Remote Tracks** from the dropdown menu.

![Figure 4](Fig4.png "Opening the Remote Tracks menu in the WashU Epigenome Browser.")

A window for adding remote tracks will appear:

![Figure 5](Fig5.png "WashU Epigenome Browser window for adding remote tracks.")

First, add the **normalized observed signal profile** and **normalized predicted signal profile**:

1. Copy and paste the first URL from Step 2.
2. Add an informative label, such as `Observed accessibility`.
3. Click **Submit**.
4. Click **Add another track** and repeat the process for the predicted profile, using a label such as `ChromBPNet predicted accessibility`.

![Figure 6](Fig6.png "Submitting a remote bigWig track to the WashU Epigenome Browser.")

![Figure 7](Fig7.png "Selecting Add another track to load an additional remote file.")

For the third bigWig—the counts sequence-contribution scores—change the track type to **Dynseq**. Select the **Track type** menu and choose **Dynseq (dynamic sequence)** from the list.

![Figure 8](Fig8.png "Selecting the Dynseq track type for a sequence-contribution bigWig.")

Dynseq displays each nucleotide as a letter whose height and direction reflect its contribution score. Positive scores indicate bases that increase the model prediction relative to the reference, whereas negative scores indicate bases that decrease it. The nucleotide letters appear only after zooming in sufficiently. Clusters of bases with large contribution scores often correspond to predictive regulatory sequence features, including transcription-factor motif instances.

Add an informative label, such as `Counts sequence-contribution map`, and submit the track.

The completed browser session should resemble the example below, with the experimentally observed profile, model-predicted profile, and sequence-contribution map aligned at the same genomic locus:

![Figure 9](Fig9.png "WashU Epigenome Browser session displaying observed and ChromBPNet-predicted accessibility profiles together with a base-resolution sequence-contribution map.")

For more information about configuring tracks, navigating loci, and sharing sessions, see the [WashU Epigenome Browser documentation](https://epigenomegateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).

## How else can I use the resources?
All ENCODE data, model sets, and model-derived sequence annotations are openly available through the [**ENCODE Portal**](https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Annotation&annotation_type=BPNet-model&annotation_type=ChromBPNet-model&status=released). The complete ENCODE GRAMMAR resource contains 3,865 experiment-specific model sets spanning TF binding, chromatin accessibility, transcription initiation, and high-throughput reporter activity.
